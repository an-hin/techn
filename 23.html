<h2>PHP and JavaScript</h2>
<p>The programming languages <b>PHP</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> allow you to make a site dynamic, i.e. responsive to user actions. For example, you can make a beautiful drop-down menu or slider.</p>
<h2>Types of scripts</h2>
    <p>For this purpose, scripts are written (English <i>script</i> - "script") - programs that allow you to respond to user actions. There are two types of scripts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>those that are executed on the server, and the result of their execution comes to the user's browser in a ready-made form. These are scripts written in the <b>PHP</b> language. <b>CMS-ki</b> are written in it – content management systems.</li>
        <li>those that are executed directly in the user's browser. These are scripts written in the <b>JavaScript</b> language. They are most often used to make the page more convenient and beautiful.</li>
    </ul>
